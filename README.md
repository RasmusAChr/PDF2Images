Convert PDF pages into images and insert them directly into your Obsidian notes, ideal for capturing key visuals like lecture slides. Optionally, add separator lines between images for organized and readable notes.

4. The images will be inserted into your note.

## Settings
**Image Quality**
Adjust the image quality to suit your needs. The default setting is 1x, but you can reduce it to as low as 0.5x for smaller file sizes and improved performance, or increase it up to 2x for the highest image clarity.

**Image Insertion Method**
Choose between two different methods for inserting images:
- Procedural: Images are generated and inserted one at a time.
- Batch: All images are generated first, then inserted simultaneously for a more streamlined process.

**Optional Line Between Images**
You can toggle the option to include or exclude an empty line beneath each image. 

**Insert headers**
Toggle the option on to generate headers for each image based on pdf page analysis.
This feature is in early development, so its effectiveness may vary depending on the PDF layout. Iâ€™m actively working to improve the algorithm to better detect different header types.

**Header size**
Choose the size of the header to be inserted above each image. You can select the following options: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`,`h4`,`h5`.

**Header extraction sensitivity**
Adjust the sensitivity of the header extraction algorithm. The default is set to `1.2`.
- Increase this value if headers are not being detected correctly. 
- Lower the value if non-headers are mistakenly being detected as headers.

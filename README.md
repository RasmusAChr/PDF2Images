### Image Quality
Adjust the image quality to suit your needs. The default setting is 1x, but you can reduce it to as low as 0.5x for smaller file sizes and improved performance, or increase it up to 2x for the highest image clarity.

### Image Insertion Method
Choose between two different methods for inserting images:
- Procedural: Images are generated and inserted one at a time.
- Batch: All images are generated first, then inserted simultaneously for a more streamlined process.

### Optional Line Between Images
You can toggle the option to include or exclude an empty line beneath each image. 

### Enable ribbon icon
You have the option to add or remove a convenient icon in the toolbar for quick access to the conversion modal.

### Attachment Folder Path
Specify the folder where images generated from the PDF will be saved. You can either manually enter the path or use the folder selection button to choose the destination.

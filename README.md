	PDF 2 Images
</h1>

This plugin allows you to easily convert PDF documents into images and insert them directly into your notes in Obsidian. It's ideal for taking notes from lecture slideshows, helping to capture important visual information from the slides.

You can also choose to insert lines between the images for better organization and clarity, making your notes easier to read and structure. Great for students or anyone in general working with visual content in their notes.

	Settings
</h2>

### Image Quality
Adjust the image quality to suit your needs. The default setting is 1x, but you can reduce it to as low as 0.5x for smaller file sizes and improved performance, or increase it up to 2x for the highest image clarity.

### Image Insertion Method
Choose between two different methods for inserting images:
- Procedural: Images are generated and inserted one at a time.
- Batch: All images are generated first, then inserted simultaneously for a more streamlined process.

### Insert headers (BETA)
Toggle the option on to generate headers for each image based on pdf page analysis.
This feature is in beta and might not work as expected with some pdf files. I am working on settings to control the how aggresive the header exctraction is.

### Header size
Choose the size of the header to be inserted above each image. You can select the following options: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`,`h4`,`h5`.

### Header extraction sensitivity
Adjust the sensitivity of the header extraction algorithm. Increase this value if headers are not being detected correctly. Lower the value if non-headers are mistakenly being detected as headers. The default is set to 1.2.

### Optional Line Between Images
You can toggle the option to include or exclude an empty line beneath each image.

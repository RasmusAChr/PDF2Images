# PDF 2 Images

Convert PDF pages into images and insert them directly into your Obsidian notes. Optionally, extract headers from each page and add or empty lines below each image for quick and easy-to-annotate notes.

## How to use

1. Activate the plugin from the Community Plugins page.
2. Open the PDF-selector by either
 	- Opening the command palette and type `Convert pdf to images`.
	- Use the ribbon in the left menu.
3. Select your PDF file and click convert.
4. The images will be inserted into your note.

## Settings
- **Image Quality**: Adjust the image quality to suit your needs. The default setting is 1x, but you can reduce it to as low as 0.5x for smaller file sizes and improved performance, or increase it up to 2x for the highest image clarity.

- **Image Insertion Method**: Choose between two different methods for inserting images:
    - Procedural: Images are generated and inserted one at a time.
    - Batch: All images are generated first, then inserted simultaneously for a more streamlined process.

- **Image seperator**: You can customize how images are separated: choose an empty line, a separator line, or no separation at all.

- **Insert headers**: Toggle the option on to generate headers for each image based on pdf page analysis. This feature is in early development, so its effectiveness may vary depending on the PDF layout. Iâ€™m actively working to improve the algorithm to better detect different header types.

- **Remove header duplicates**: Prevent identical headers from being inserted multiple times if consecutive PDF pages have the same detected header.

- **Header size**: Choose the size of the header to be inserted above each image. You can select the following options: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`,`h4`,`h5`.

- **Header extraction sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of the header extraction algorithm. The default is set to `1.2`.
    - Increase this value if headers are not being detected correctly. 
    - Lower the value if non-headers are mistakenly being detected as headers.
